# IOT Home Automation

This project is aimed at developing an Internet of Things (IoT) system that allows for the remote control of lights and fans using Arduino and relay. By incorporating IoT technology, users can operate these devices from a remote location through the use of a smartphone or other internet-connected device. Additionally, the use of Arduino microcontroller and relay modules ensures that the system is robust, efficient and easy to operate. With this system, users can easily regulate their home lighting and fan systems without the need for physical contact, thus promoting energy efficiency and convenience.
